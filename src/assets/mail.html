        It is important and mandatory for LATAM, that your company keep us
        updated on the status of all the open repair orders.
      </p>

      <p class="justify-text">
        Most regrettably, we haven't found a clear and efficient source to
        achieve a constant follow-up process for our repair orders. Because of
        this, we will begin to periodically send a form (attached) with a
        LATAM-defined format meant to keep track of our open orders. We ask that
        you follow the instructions included in the attached file and to keep us
        informed of the status of our components through this tool.
      </p>

      <p class="justify-text">
        We request for your reply to take no longer than 3 working days after
        receiving the form.

        We trust in your support to help us in our supply chain process and
        reduce the impact in our passangers.

        From today on please do NOT deliver any material to Kuehne + Nagel. This

        regular procedure.
