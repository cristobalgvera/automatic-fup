          It is important for LATAM that your company keep us updated on the
          status of all the open repair orders.

        <p class="justify-text">
          We will begin to periodically every 15 days send a form (attached)
          with a LATAM-defined format meant to keep track of our open orders. We
          ask that you follow the instructions included below and to keep us
          informed of the status of our components through this tool.
